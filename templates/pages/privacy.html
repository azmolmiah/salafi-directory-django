            <p >Data protection law requires us to only process your personal data if we satisfy one or more legal grounds. These are set out in data protection law.</p>
            <p >Consent
              In certain circumstances, we process your personal data after obtaining your consent to do so for the purposes of:</p>

            <h4>Who we share your personal data with and where it is stored by them</h4>
            <p >We may provide your personal data to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>our suppliers and services providers, who perform certain business services for us and act as “processors” of your personal data on our behalf; and</li>
              <li>other organisations, who use your personal data for their own purposes and are “controllers” of such data in their own right. Such organisations may be located outside the EEA.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>In some cases the personal data we collect from you may, for the purposes set out above, be transferred outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and such destinations may not have laws which protect your personal data to the same extent as in the EEA.

Such clauses provide adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of the privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals when personal data is transferred to locations for which there is no adequacy decision. <br>

            <h4>Your rights</h4>
            <p>You have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Right to be informed: </strong>You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your personal data and your rights. This is why we are providing you with the information in this Privacy Policy.</li>
              <li><strong>Right of access: </strong>You have the right to obtain access to your personal data (if we are processing it) and certain other information (similar to that provided in this Privacy Policy).

This is not a general right to erasure; there are exceptions.</li>
              <li><strong>Right to restrict processing: </strong>You have the right to ‘block’ or suppress further use of your personal data in certain circumstances.

              <li><strong>Right to withdraw consent to processing: </strong>If you have given your consent to us to process your personal data for a particular purpose (for example, direct marketing), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time (although if you do so, it does not mean that any processing of your personal data up to that point is unlawful).</li>
              <li><strong>Right to make a complaint to the data protection authorities: </strong> You have the right to make a complaint to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) if you are unhappy with how we have handled your personal data or believe our processing of your personal data does not comply with data protection law.</li>
